                     the beginning of the space race to the United States and 
                      winning the space race was the most important task.<br>
                     <br> Yet‚Ä¶<br>
                    <br>‚Ä¢	the Soviets were the first to send a man into space while the United States were working on

                   it has opened a new path for advances in science and technology and will for years to come.<br>
                  
                    <br>‚Ä¢ In 2010 they have developed further technology for manned missions in space
